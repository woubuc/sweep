# This is an example .cleanuprc file. It lists the directories that should be
# deleted. Each line should contain one path, relative to the directory that
# the .cleanuprc file is in, followed by a newline character (enter).

# Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored. This makes the
# .cleanuprc file compatible with .gitignore files for syntax
# highlighting purposes. However, .cleanuprc does NOT support regex
# or wildcard syntax, and only works with directories.


# If a .cleanuprc file is found, none of the default paths will match
# and only the contents of the .cleanuprc file will count.
node_modules

# Paths should NOT start with a leading slash, but may end with a
# trailing slash.
target/


# If a listed path does not exist in the directory, it is ignored.
this-directory-does-not-exist/


# Nested paths will only delete the last directory. The below line
# would delete the `bar` directory, but leave `foo` intact.
foo/bar/
